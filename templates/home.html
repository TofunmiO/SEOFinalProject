                            My name is Henry Baldacci, and I am from Kenya and a Junior in Computer Science and Mathematics at Calvin University. I focused on the back-end of this project and API integration with the front-end. This is a great way to show people what Africa actually looks like, and educates people on the true beauty of the continent.

                            My name is Onyii Nnebe. I am from Nigeria and a Junior at the University of Georgia studying Management Information Systems. I worked mostly on the front-end development and design of the webpage. An interesting thing about me is that I am a self-taught music producer.  I really love the idea of this webpage because it's sad that people have a skewed view of Africa and I hope this page will broadcast how beautiful Africa is. I hope you all enjoy!
